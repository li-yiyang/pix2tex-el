If you are still coping LaTeX formula from textbook...
Or if you're just tired like me with so much type,
type, and type work. Please try OCR LaTeX in Emacs.

This project is based on [[https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR/][lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR]] work
and [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-epc][kiwanami/emacs-epc]] work. In theory, it should
be applied into any platform and editors.

However, currently, it depends macOS =screencapture=
command (other system support will be consided if
needed) and I think I'd only work on Emacs.

* Current Status
+ only macOS
+ =epc:call-sync= only, which is not so pleasant

* TODO Future Works
+ =epc:call-deferred= to support async calling
+ linux support
+ formatted LaTeX ouput (?)
