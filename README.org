If you are still coping LaTeX formula from textbook...
Or if you're just tired like me with so much type,
type, and type work. Please try OCR LaTeX in Emacs.

This project is based on [[https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR/][lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR]] work
and [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-epc][kiwanami/emacs-epc]] work. In theory, it should
be applied into any platform and editors.

However, currently, it depends macOS =screencapture=
command (other system support will be consided if
needed) and I think I'd only work on Emacs.

** How to Use It?
You'd need:
+ Python with [[https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR/][pix2tex]], [[https://github.com/tkf/python-epc][python-epc]]

  #+begin_src shell
    pip install pix2tex epc
  #+end_src
+ Emacs [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-epc][emacs-epc]]

  #+begin_src elisp
    (use-package epc)

    (use-package pix2tex-el
      :load-path "/path/to/pix2tex-el"
      :config
      (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                (lambda ()
                  (add-hook 'pix2tex-el-insert-hook
                            #'org-latex-preview 0 nil)))
  #+end_src

Then all you need to do is to run =M-x pix2tex-el-insert=.
(Or you could bind it to some key if you like).
  
* Current Status
+ only macOS
+ =epc:call-deferred= support (only), but little tricky
  implementation.

* TODO Future Works
+ [x] =epc:call-deferred= to support async calling
+ [ ] linux support
+ [ ] formatted LaTeX ouput (?)
